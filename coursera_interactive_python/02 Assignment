""" 
You will interact with your program using an input field and 
several buttons. For this project, we will ignore the canvas and print the 
computer's responses in the console. Building an initial version of your 
project that prints information in the console is a development strategy 
that you should use in later projects as well. Focusing on getting the logic 
of the program correct before trying to make it display the information in 
some “nice” way on the canvas usually saves lots of time since debugging 
logic errors in graphical output can be tricky.
